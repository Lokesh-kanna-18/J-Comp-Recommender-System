# J-Comp-Recommender-System
In this project, we have proposed a personalized Fashion Recommender system that generates recommendations for the user based on an input given. Unlike the conventional systems that rely on the user's previous purchases and history, this project aims at using an image of a product given as input by the user to generate recommendations since many-a-time people see something that they are interested in and tend to look for products that are like that. We have built a fashion recommendation    system capable of learning a person’s clothing style and preferences by extracting a variety of attributes from his/her clothing images. We use convolutional neural networks to process the images from Fashion Product Images Dataset. These attributes are then fed to a similarity model to retrieve closest similar images as recommendations. We have used Model-based recommendation systems that involves building a model based on the dataset. In other words, we extract some information from the dataset, and use that as a "model" to make recommendations without having to use the complete dataset every time. Feature extraction is done using pre-trained models (CNN based architecture) such as VGG, Resnet and Densenet. CNN model is used to identify the closer images and transfer learning model is used to improve accuracy and speed.
